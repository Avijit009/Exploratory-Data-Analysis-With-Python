1. Data Cleaning

Loading the Dataset: Start by loading the dataset using Pandas.

Handling Null Values: Identify and handle Null values. This might include removing rows with too many missing values or imputing missing values with appropriate statistical methods.

Data Type Corrections: Ensure that the data types of each column are appropriate for the analysis.

3. Rename Columns

Standardizing Column Names: Rename the columns to be more descriptive and consistent. For example, convert all column names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.

5. Age Calculation

Calculating Age: If the dataset includes a birthdate or a similar field, calculate the participants' age. This could be done by subtracting the birthdate from the race date.

7. Reorder Columns

Organizing Data: Reorder columns for better readability and analysis. Place more critical columns, like participant name, age, and race details, at the beginning of the dataset.

9. Data Visualization
Visual Analysis: Use libraries like Seaborn to create visualization.

Summary:
The EDA of the Ultra Marathon dataset involved cleaning and organizing the data, including renaming columns and calculating participants' ages. The dataset was then reordered for better analysis. Various visualizations were created to explore patterns and trends, providing insights into participants' demographics and race performance. This analysis can help understand the factors influencing ultra-marathon performance and participant demographics.
